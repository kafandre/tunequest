## Important Notes

- **Spotify Premium Required**: The game only works with Spotify Premium accounts due to API limitations
- **Browser Autoplay**: The first song might not play automatically - just click the play button
- **Legal Notice**: Using Spotify API for games may be against their terms of service - use at your own risk

## Features

- **Digital Hitster Mode**: Play with your own Spotify playlists  
- **Automatic Deduplication**: No duplicate songs across multiple playlists  
- **Random Track Selection**: Never play the same song twice in a session  
- **Track Information Reveal**: Show year, artist, and song name  
- **QR Code Mode**: Compatible with physical Hitster cards  
- **Progress Tracking**: See how many songs you've played  

## Troubleshooting

**"Can't connect to Spotify"**
- Make sure you have Spotify Premium
- Check that your Client ID and Client Secret are correct
- Ensure Spotify app is running on your device

**"Songs won't play"**
- Open Spotify app on your computer/phone
- Make sure you're logged into the same account
- Try refreshing the browser page

**"Invalid playlist URL"**
- Copy the playlist URL directly from Spotify
